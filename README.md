# chat-automation


This Python application uses Selenium to do repatitive tasks like creating tickets in Team Dynamics for certain key issues. It also sends canned messages in LibChat for responding to student technical support issues.

I created this program to help other technicians quickly respond to some of the more common issues brought to them. It has been adopted and utilized by some support technitions in my help desk and has dramatically reduced the time it takes to fix key issues.
